# The-Simpsons

This is the Simpsons app which shows the family member of the Simpsons. You can get the name, job, and image of the Simpsons family member just by clicking the name of them. I used two viewControllers file and one class file. In the viewController screen, I inherited from UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource classes to contruct the table view. I ordered the name of the Simpson family with table view. I created mySimpsons array and placed all family member there. I also used three essetial functions which are numberOfRowsInSection, cellForRowAt, and didSelectRowAt to construct my table. Besides, in order to change screen, I added my viewController "Navigation Controller" and segue feature. In additon, I benefited from prepare for segue function in the viewController to implement the segue feature completely. As for class, I created Simpson class as a blueprint to build my app and I used Simpson class in my viewControllers frequently. Additionally, I constructed init function in the class to use when I create an object from the class. I think that creating a model and then applying it is the best way to build an app.
